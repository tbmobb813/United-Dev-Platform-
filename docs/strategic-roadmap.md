**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** September 22, 2025  
**Current Branch:** feat/ui

## 📋 Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for the United Development Platform (UDP), a unified
web + mobile + AI development environment. Based on comprehensive analysis of current state and
market opportunities, this roadmap prioritizes immediate wins while building toward long-term
strategic goals.

## 🎯 Current State Assessment

### ✅ **Completed Foundation**

- **Collaborative Editor**: Real-time sync with Yjs, user presence, cursor tracking
- **Multi-Platform Architecture**: Next.js web app, Expo mobile app, Electron desktop wrapper
- **AI Framework**: Complete AIManager with OpenAI/Anthropic integration structure
- **Monorepo Structure**: Well-organized packages (ai, ui, editor-core, types) and apps
- **Core Technologies**: TypeScript, Monaco Editor, React Native, turbo build system

### 🟡 **Partially Implemented**

- **AI Services**: Framework exists but needs API key configuration and full integration
- **Mobile Experience**: Basic navigation structure but lacks collaborative editor integration
- **File Management**: UI components exist but no backend persistence layer
- **Development Tooling**: Missing comprehensive linting, formatting, and testing setup

### ❌ **Critical Gaps**

- **Backend Infrastructure**: No persistent storage, user management, or file system
- **Authentication System**: Basic localStorage implementation, no real authentication
- **Git Integration**: Referenced in documentation but not implemented
- **Production Pipeline**: No CI/CD, deployment configuration, or environment management
