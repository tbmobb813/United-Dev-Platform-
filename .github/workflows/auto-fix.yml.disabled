name: Auto-fix code style (disabled)

# This file replaces the original `auto-fix.yml` while running act locally.
# The original file contained duplicate top-level keys (two workflows in one
# file) which causes `act` to fail to parse workflows. If you want to re-
# enable the workflow, please fix the YAML by splitting it into two separate
# workflow files or remove the duplicated sections.
