- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting,
  etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
  within 48 hours.
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment of the reported
  vulnerability within 5 business days.
- **Status Updates**: We will send you regular updates about our progress, at
  least every 10 business days.
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days, and
  other vulnerabilities within 90 days.

### What to Expect

After you submit a vulnerability report, here's what you can expect:

1. **Confirmation**: We'll confirm that we've received your report and begin
   investigating.
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate the issue and determine its impact and
   severity.
