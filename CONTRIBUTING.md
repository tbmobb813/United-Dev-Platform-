## Contributing Process

### 1. Find or Create an Issue

- Check existing issues before creating a new one
- Use issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- Discuss significant changes in an issue before starting work

### 2. Create a Branch

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 3. Make Changes

- Follow our coding standards
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all checks pass locally

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
pnpm check          # Run all checks
pnpm test           # Run tests
pnpm validate-env   # Validate environment
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

- Reference related issues
- Request review from maintainers

## Coding Standards

### General Principles

- **Clarity**: Write code that is easy to read and understand
- **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns and conventions
- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications
- **Security**: Follow security best practices

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
pnpm lint           # Check for issues
pnpm lint:fix       # Fix automatically
pnpm format         # Format with Prettier
```

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Provide explicit types for function parameters and return values
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Prefer `type` for unions and primitives
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary

### React Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices for performance
- Use meaningful component and prop names
- Write components that are easy to test

### API Guidelines

- Use RESTful conventions
- Provide clear error messages
- Validate all inputs
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Document all endpoints

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

### Examples

```bash
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication
fix(api): resolve memory leak in WebSocket connections
docs(setup): update development environment guide
test(user): add unit tests for user service
```
